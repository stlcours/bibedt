================================================================================

Version 0.7.2 (14-08-2006)
- Fixed several other minor drawing bugs in list view.
- Correctly draws focus rect when list view has focus on XP.
- It's no longer possible to change config files but only to change a config
  directory which contains the config files.
- Uses new style filedialog where possible.
- Search -> Find in List view does not bookmark found items but selectes them by
  default. Added Mark all button to dialog to bookmark all found items.
- Search -> Find searches only visible items.
- Added Fold all/Expand all commands to source view popup menu.
- Fixed some edit problems (Copy, Paste etc.) in record view.
- Edit -> Copy in list view also copies as formatted HTML with the copyhtml.xsl
  style sheet.
- Added [find("str")] and [filter("name")] DDE commands.
- There is now some support for localizing BibEdt for you language, but I don't
  provide the language DLLs. If you like this program in your language make a 
  resource DLL, see the MSDN library how, and put the DLL in a subfolder with the
  name 'lang'. The version number must be the same as BibEdts and the name of the
  language must be in the comment field of the version resource.
- More flxible search in list view.
- Remove not required fields when generating a BibTeX file from an AUX file.
- Fixed some problems with the HTML viewer (links, scrolling etc.)
- Change the default fonts of the HTML viewer
- Added Local URL menuitem to record view
- Added basic @string expansion. Values with embedded strings does not work, also
  concatenation of strings is not expanded. Bug (sic) #1537633
- Uses XSLT for key generation, implements FRs #1475451 and part of #1502124
- Added "list of authors, journals, titles", FR #1537999
- Resolves crossref.

Version 0.7.1 (10-05-2006)
- Added Menuitems and shortcuts to activate a View.
- Added Toggle Quicksearch command.
- Generic exporter. Export to virtually any format using XSL transformation. I
  love it!!! Removed the built in HTML exporter, since it's much more flexible to
  do it with XSLT, e.g. with plain.xsl. Didn't remove the plain text exporter,
  although you could do it with XSLT as well, but with some linmitations. If you've
  written an exporter, please submit a patch and I'll include it in the distribution,
  thanks!
- Updated to YAZ 2.1.12 and some other libraries
- Added Insert Key (Menu Record) command. Inserts the selected key into your LaTeX
  Editor. Before you must configure Options -> Default LaTeX Editor. Enter the 
  classname of the toplevel and child window of your editor. You could use programs
  like GetWnd (http://web.utanet.at/ascherst/files/getwnd.zip) to find out the
  classnames.
- Replaced RTF preview with HTML preview that is completely customizeable with
  the preview.xsl stylesheet.
- Added [focus("key")] DDE command.
- DDE commands are case insensitive.
- Added Automatic Key Generation for all, part of FR #1475451.
- Items with missing fields have different text color.
- Fixed bug #1464177: Drawing bug in List view

Version 0.6.4 (26-10-2005)
- Added stylesheet to transform XML -> RDF with the Dublin Core notation. This
  should make FR #1237432 obsolete. This way I do not need to care what format
  you could like, you just can edit xml2rdf.xsl.
- Fixed exception in Find Duplicates dialog.
- Fixed bug #1331170: Filter [all fields] doesn't work.
- Quicksearching [All Fields] searches also the key, related to bug #1331170.
  
Version 0.6.3 (15-10-2005)
- Disable special character conversion for certain fields in config.bib. Add
    convert_url={false},
    convert_local-url={false}
  to the @options item to disable conversion for url and local-url fields or delete
  config.bib.
- Filter defined in config.bib are appended to filter defined in a file.
- Shows missing fields in Record view.
- Resolves DOI addresses.
- Apply filter to bibitem with a dialog.
- Added XML Exporter. Supplied with the program is a XML style sheet file (plain.xsl)
  to format the transform it to HTML. Edit this file if you wish.
- Added Toolbar customization. Added some additional toolbar buttons which can be
  added to the toolbar with the customize dialog (View -> Toolbars -> Customize).
- Bugfixes.

Version 0.6.2 (10-09-2005)
- Better search results.
- Converts search results from UTF-8 to ISO Latin-1.
- Online search dialog is modeless.
- Attempts to find the type of an item.
- Better formating of search results.
- Optionally save password for online search. WARNING: It is saved plain to the
  profiles file!

Version 0.5.4 (27-08-2005)

  to the target file.

  files.

  require sorting the file twice.

- Removed Row select option, has always full row select.
- Shows focused item even when the list view does not have the focus.
- Generate a BibTeX file from an AUX file.
- Added Some support for Crossref field.
- Field list does not exit edit mode when other window gets the focus -> more
  comfortable editing, hopefully.
- The documentation is no longer part of the binary distribution, download it extra
  from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=142263&package_id=161101
  I assume not much need it and why waste bandwidth for something that is not needed?
- Significant performance improvmenets with new string functions, some code is
  about 3 times faster. Now even tugboat.bib (1.2 MB with ~2300 items) loads and
  saves in an acceptable time on my computer (PIII, 500 MHz, 256 MB RAM).
